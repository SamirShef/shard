Access to private member.

Bad code:
```shard
struct Human {
    var age: i32,
}

fun main() {
    var human: Human = Human { age: 12 };
    var age: i32 = human.age;
//                       ^^^ private member
}
```

Good code:
```shard
struct Human {
    pub var age: i32,
//  ^^^ `pub` access modifier
}

fun main() {
    var human: Human = Human { age: 12 };
    var age: i32 = human.age;
//                       ^^^ public member
}
```
