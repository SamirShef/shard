Field does not declared.

Bad code:
```shard
struct Human {
    var age: i32,
}

fun main() {
    var human: Human = Human { age: 12 };
    var age: i32 = human.weight;
//                       ^^^^^^ does not declared in `Human`
}
```

Good code:
```shard
struct Human {
    var age: i32,
}

fun main() {
    var human: Human = Human { age: 12 };
    var age: i32 = human.age;
}
```
