The structure field has already been initialized.

Bad code:
```shard
struct Human {
    var age: i32,
    var weight: f32,
    var height: f32,
}

fun main() {
    var human: Human = Human { age: 16, age: 25 };
//                                      ^^^^^^^ already initialized field
}
```

Good code:
```shard
struct Human {
    var age: i32,
    var weight: f32,
    var height: f32,
}

fun main() {
    var human: Human = Human { age: 16 };
}
```
